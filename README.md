This DAO want to function like state with currency, it will implement all control for state like ( currency, social security, taxes, retirment ... ) this DAO refers to France State so maybe some functionality of ur state will not be implemented. Feel free to uprgrade this code :)

This DAO will implement 1 curency ( ERC20 ) in this case DT for DAO Token.

This DAO will implement NFT ( ERC721 ): 1 for ur properties (homes), 1 for ur jobs ( CDI, CDD, freelance and entreprise ), 1 for social security ( and 1 for mutuelle in french ).
